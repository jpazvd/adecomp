$H(I_{m})$ = $f(Income_{m},0 , 0 , 0 ,0 )$

$H(I_{d})$ = $f(Income_{m},Transfers_{f},Transfers_{s},Taxes_{f},Taxes_{s})$


where,

* $I_m$ is your market income, where all other components are zero (@ t=1), and $I_d$ is your disposable income, where all additional four components are non-zero (@ t=2); and,
* H is any class of poverty rate you might be interested in.
